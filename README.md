Fork of the Tamagotchi Emulator 4 Pebble by StefanBauwens with following changes:
- added auto sync of the time on start and all 2 hours if drift is above 30 seconds
- autosave all 5 minutes
- save states are stored on watch (fallback via phone)
- added vibration when tamagotchi needs something
- support for tama-p1.bin to have it on the watch, no need to load rom from watch on start anymore
- added time, battery status and date on the frame around the tamagotchi screen (updated all 30 seconds)
- some small fix to avoid auto close when idle

- to do: upload script to modify tama-p1.bin that are found all around the internet to be compatible

- With binary on watch basically all phone dependency has been removed. App runs without the need of the phone 

- Note: bin file needs to be put into resources/data folder, not provided here in this repo!

## Features & Updates:
v1.0:
- Tamagotchi P1/P2 Emulation
- Support for external ROM integration (via Settings page)
- State saving & loading on closing/opening watchapp
- Support for [Tamagotchi API Server](https://github.com/StefanBauwens/Tamagotchi-API) 
- Support for Time (Steel), Time Round, Pebble 2 (Duo), Time 2 and Round 2.

## Getting a ROM url
To run this Emulator it will need a Tamagotchi P1 or P2 rom in u12_t form in text format. I am not allowed to distribute this with the app, but it is possible for you to add a link to this in the app settings. Luckily for you it seems a link like that already has been created: https://pastebin.com/raw/iN0pfyr7 for P1 or https://pastebin.com/raw/TXkwnBZA for the (Japanese)P2.
Thank you to the kind person for creating these!

## Server for running in background (optional)
By default the Tamagotchi will save its state when quitting the app and restore it the next time you use it. 

It works fine like this but if you would like your tamagotchi to continue working in the backround you can make use of my [Tamagotchi API Service](https://github.com/StefanBauwens/Tamagotchi-API) and run it on your own server. 

Once set up, when you close the app your save state is sent to your server and continues to live on there. When you open the watch app next time, the save state is fetched from the server and runs on the Pebble again. 

## How to use
You can look up the original instructions for the Tamagotchi P1 toy. 
A, B and C buttons are mapped to UP, SELECT and DOWN buttons respectively. Pressing the BACK button saves the state and quits the app.

## Issues
I've created this with support for most Pebble watches, but have only tested this on a Pebble 2 Duo so far. The emulator on CloudPebble seemed to work fine and so I hope it's also the case with the actual watches. If any major bugs are noticed feel free to create an issue here on Github!

## Credits
This project implements [TamaLib](https://github.com/jcrona/tamalib/) by [jcrona](https://github.com/jcrona). I also want to point out that jcrona has created [PebbleGotchi](https://github.com/jcrona/pebblegotchi) about 5 years ago. 

I believe my implementation to be significantly different to warrant my own publication in the store. In fact PebbleGotchi was never uploaded to the Pebble store as it required the end user to supply it with a ROM and recompile.
